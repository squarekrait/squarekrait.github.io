<p>In the void, a lone Krait sails,<br>
Through the stars, where darkness prevails.<br>
Silent and cold, it braves the night,<br>
A square ship, a beacon of light.</p>

<p>Asteroids threaten, pirates pursue,<br>
Yet its spirit remains ever true.<br>
Hull may be battered, shields worn thin,<br>
But it fights on, defiant within.</p>

<p>Lonely Krait, through space it roams,<br>
Seeking solace in celestial homes.<br>
Though perils abound, it never quits,<br>
For in its heart, a fire still lit.</p>
